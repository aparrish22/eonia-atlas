# Roanthur, the Cloudless City

Roanthur rises along the southeastern coast of Kircia, where the sea air tastes faintly of citrus,
smoke from grilled fish, and brine. Its academies and wharves coexist in a polite rivalry:
knowledge arrives by ship as often as it does by lecture.

## What travelers remember

- White stone warmed by late sun  
- Lantern-lit alleys near the festivities district  
- The Academy’s quiet courtyards  
- The sound of waves under the night markets

> “Some cities teach you history. Roanthur teaches you momentum.”
