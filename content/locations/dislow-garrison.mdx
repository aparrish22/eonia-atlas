# Dislow Garrison

Dislow Garrison is less a single fortress and more a **stone promise** driven into the Dislow Heights. Its walls cling to the mountain face, tiered and angular, with battlements that stare unblinking toward the Lucelus Desert. From the main courtyard, you can see the pale dunes stretching to the horizon — and on certain nights, when the wind is wrong, you can hear things moving out there that are neither caravan nor storm.

The Garrison is the **first and last line of defense** for the eastern lands of Kircia. It was hewn into the mountains generations ago, after the earliest recorded incursions of sand-born creatures and bandit-legions who vanished into the dunes as quickly as they appeared. The stone here bears scars from those attacks: melted parapets from unknown alchemies, claw gouges that do not match any known beast, and arrowheads found buried too deep in the mortar to be from simple raiders.

## Structure and Layout

Dislow is built in **three main tiers**:

- **Lower Ward** – Barracks, stables, training yards, and supply caverns. New recruits first learn the feel of stone underfoot here long before they are trusted near the upper walls.  
- **Middle Keep** – Command halls, map rooms, messenger roosts, and the infirmary. The tactical heart of the Garrison, where scouts bring word of desert movements and officers debate how to respond.  
- **High Bastion** – Narrow walkways and high towers that bite into the cold air of the Heights. Ballistae, signal beacons, and the long-range watchers keep constant vigil here, especially on moonless nights.

Secret stairwells and old mining shafts lace the mountain beneath Dislow. Officially, they are sealed. Unofficially, anyone who has spent more than a year at the Garrison knows that “sealed” is a flexible term.

## Life at the Garrison

Soldiers posted to Dislow are said to be **“married to the sky and the stone”**. The air is thin and cold, and the routines are relentless: dawn drills on the lower terraces, midday patrol rotations, night watches that often pass in quiet — until they don’t.

Life here shapes people quickly:

- Recruits from inland farmholds learn to read distant dust plumes the way city folk read crowds.  
- Veterans develop a sixth sense for when the desert is *too quiet*.  
- Stories of the **Guard Mountaineers** — elite climbers and scouts who traverse sheer rock to flank enemies or rescue the lost — circulate like half-legend, half-warning.

## Threats from the Lucelus Desert

The Lucelus Desert is not simply “sand and heat.” From Dislow’s walls, it is an **active frontier**:

- **Sand-wraiths** and other strange creatures sometimes test the wards along the lower cliffs.  
- Bandits and renegade warbands use the dunes as cover, striking along trade routes and retreating before regular forces can respond.  
- There are also rumors of **buried structures** far beyond the range of normal patrols — flickers of unnatural light at the horizon, seen only on certain nights.

Official reports remain cautious. Unofficially, many at the Garrison believe Dislow is not just watching the desert, but **containing** something that should never be allowed to cross the Heights.

## Ties to Kircia and Azuria

Dislow Garrison answers to the Kircia Crown, but its messengers ride often to **Roanthur** for supplies, reinforcements, and sometimes arcane support from **Azuria Academy**. Certain Masters maintain standing agreements with the Garrison’s commanders:

- Warding specialists help strengthen the boundary sigils along the lower passes.  
- Apothecaries from Azuria test new stabilizing draughts on scouts who must survive long patrols under harsh desert conditions.  
- On rare occasions, promising Apprentices volunteer to accompany resupply caravans, using the journey as a brutal practicum in field magic and survival.

> *Some in Roanthur call Dislow a remote assignment, a punishment post.  
> Those who have stood its walls know better. It is where Eonia’s stories might end — or hold firm — without anyone in the cities ever realizing how close things came.*
