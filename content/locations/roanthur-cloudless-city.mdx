# Roanthur, the Cloudless City

Roanthur spreads along the coast like a fan of **sunlit stone and shadowed alleys**, layered in terraces that climb away from the harbor. Sailors named it the *Cloudless City* long before Kircia’s maps did, swearing that storms skirt its horizon more often than they strike its docks. Whether that is the work of chance, currents, or quiet wards from Azuria Academy, no one agrees — but the name remained.

From the lower piers to the upper terraces, Roanthur is **never truly still**. Carts rattle over cobbles, market callers compete with gulls, and somewhere in the city, a student is always awake and worrying about an exam.

Roanthur rises along the southeastern coast of Kircia, where the sea air tastes faintly of citrus,
smoke from grilled fish, and brine. Its academies and wharves coexist in a polite rivalry:
knowledge arrives by ship as often as it does by lecture.

## Districts and Landmarks

Roanthur’s character shifts as you climb:

- **Harbor District** – Cranes, warehouses, taverns, and the constant churn of ships arriving and departing. Smells of brine, tar, grilled fish, and citrus peel mingle here.  
- **Market Quarter** – Stalls and shops pressed along narrow streets, selling everything from imported spices to student-grade spell components.  
- **Civic Ring** – Administrative buildings, courthouses, and the Kircia Crown’s local representative halls. The stone is cleaner here; the gossip is sharper.  
- **Academy Rise** – The slopes and streets leading up to **Azuria Academy**. Bookshops, tea houses, ink sellers, and small hostels cluster here, catering to Initiates and visitors alike.

Lantern festivals and public gatherings often spill from one district into another, especially during major events like the **Cloudless Eve Festival**.

## The City’s Rhythm

Roanthur’s days and nights have distinct flavors:

- **Morning** – Fisher-calls from the harbor, cart-runners shouting paths, early lectures at the Academy.  
- **Afternoon** – Market bargaining at full tilt, civic disputes being aired, students darting between courtyards and cafes.  
- **Evening** – Street performers, drifting music from inns, study groups forming in cramped rooms above shops.  
- **Late Night** – Quiet conversations on Academy balconies, patrols along the walls, the distant glow of ships leaving under starlight.

On the night before exams, this rhythm bends. Students spill into the city in clusters: some chasing distraction in the festival streets, others clinging to last-chance notes on quiet benches while revelry swirls around them.

## Ties to Eonia and Beyond

Roanthur is Kircia’s **face to the wider world**:

- Trade ships bring goods — and problems — from distant coasts.  
- Envoys from other realms often make their first negotiations here before being invited inland.  
- Travelers who never see Kircia’s Heartlands or the eastern frontier still carry away impressions of the kingdom based entirely on their time in Roanthur.

The city is also where stories from places like **Dislow Garrison** and the **Lucelus Desert** arrive, distilled through tired scouts and creative storytellers. Not all such tales are accurate. Enough are true to keep people listening.

## Understories

Beneath the bright stone, Roanthur has shadows:

- Informal networks of students trade notes, favors, and rumors that never reach official channels.  
- Certain guilds use the city’s festivals to mask quieter meetings and exchanges.  
- Old stonework in the oldest districts does not match current maps or architectural records, suggesting Roanthur has been rebuilt over foundations no one fully understands.

## What travelers remember

- White stone warmed by late sun  
- Lantern-lit alleys near the festivities district  
- The Academy’s quiet courtyards  
- The sound of waves under the night markets

> *To some, Roanthur is just a port.  
> To others, it is the place where everything begins — or where they hope it never ends.*
