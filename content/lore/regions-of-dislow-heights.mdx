# Regions Around the Dislow Heights

The **Dislow Heights** form a jagged barrier between Kircia’s interior and the **Lucelus Desert**. To understand Dislow Garrison’s importance, one must understand the regions that feed into it, depend on it, or vanish beyond its watch.

## The Blythgon Vale

West of the Heights lies the **Blythgon Vale**, a forested corridor carved by ancient rivers and trade routes.

- Serves as the primary **approach route** for supplies and reinforcements heading toward Dislow.  
- Villages along the Vale thrive on caravans, lumber, and game.  
- Rumors persist of older stonework beneath the forest — ruins that do not match current maps.

The Vale acts as both lifeline and filter: anything large moving toward the Heights is noticed here first.

## The Eastern Marches

The lands immediately below the Dislow Heights are known simply as the **Eastern Marches**.

- Thin, wind-swept settlements where families live in the shadow of the fortress and the mountain.  
- Fields are stony, but hardy crops and livestock persist.  
- Local folklore is thick with stories of lights in the night and “voices on the wind” coming down from the Heights.

People here have little patience for abstract politics. They measure Kircia’s care for them in food, patrols, and whether the warning fires on the cliffs are ever allowed to go dark.

## The Lucelus Desert

Beyond the Heights lies the **Lucelus Desert**, visible from Dislow’s upper walls on clear days: a sea of pale sand that shifts in long, slow currents.

- Known hazards include bandit bands, rare but devastating sandstorms, and creatures adapted to the harsh environment.  
- Less understood phenomena include glass-smooth stretches of fused sand and occasional mirage-like structures at the horizon that persist longer than natural illusions should.

Officially, Kircia claims no permanent holdings beyond the Heights. Unofficially, small expeditions occasionally push into the desert — some return with maps and samples, others not at all.

## Dislow’s Place Among These Regions

**Dislow Garrison** serves as both sentinel and hinge:

- Watching the Lucelus Desert for signs of movement.  
- Serving as a hard stop for anything that attempts to cross into the Eastern Marches.  
- Acting as a point of coordination for Wardens, scouts, and any arcane support dispatched from Azuria.

From Roanthur’s perspective, these regions are lines on a map and numbers in a report. From the vantage of Dislow’s walls, they are living, shifting realities that can change an entire season’s plans with a single dust plume on the horizon.
