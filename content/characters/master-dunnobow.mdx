# Master Dunnobow

When a classroom falls silent at Azuria Academy, it is often because **Master Dunnobow** has stepped through the door. His presence is not dramatic; there is no swirl of cloak or theatrical flare. Instead, there is a quiet sharpening of the air, the sense that every misaligned parchment and crooked ink pot has just been judged — and found wanting.

Dunnobow specializes in **pattern magic and structural sigils**, the kind of work that holds bridges together, reinforces wards, and ensures that experimental constructs do not collapse onto their makers. His reputation is for **precision without mercy**, but students who endure his courses emerge with a foundation that does not crack easily, even under field conditions.

## Appearance

- Tall, lean, with graying hair kept short and strictly parted.  
- Wears dark, minimally adorned robes with subtle embroidered diagrams along the cuffs and collar.  
- His eyes have the habit of pausing on details — a student's stance, an uneven line — and filing them away without comment.  
- Carries a simple, well-used staff more as a measure of pacing than as a focus.

## Personality

- **Exacting** – Dunnobow rarely raises his voice; he does not need to. Disappointment delivered in a quiet sentence is often worse than any shouted reprimand.  
- **Fair** – Students who work hard, regardless of origin or initial skill, find him unexpectedly supportive when it matters.  
- **Unimpressed by theatrics** – Grand claims or flashy displays of power earn little more than a raised eyebrow.  
- Holds a dry, occasionally cutting sense of humor that surfaces when students least expect it.

## Notable Scenes

- **First Lecture to Initiates** – He draws a simple circle on the board and spends the entire session explaining every way a “simple circle” can fail to hold under stress. Half the class leaves unsettled. A few leave determined to learn more.  
- **Quiet Conversation After an Accident** – Following a near-miss in a practice chamber, Dunnobow finds a shaken student lingering alone. The conversation that follows contains more reassurance and practical advice than any of his formal lectures, though he insists afterward that it “never happened.”  
- **Recommendation for the Frontier** – Rumors among upper-level Apprentices whisper that Dunnobow occasionally recommends a select few for postings near **Dislow Garrison**, believing their structural skills could mean the difference between a stable outpost and a collapsed disaster.

> *“You do not build patterns to impress your peers,” Dunnobow tells his classes.  
> “You build them so that when the worst arrives, they do not break.”*
