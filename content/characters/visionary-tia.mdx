# Visionary Tia

Visionary Tia is often seen on the **Sky Terraces** of Azuria, cloak pulled close against the wind, gaze fixed on a point of sky or distant sea that only she seems to see clearly. Students speak of her softly, as if volume alone might draw unwanted attention. Some say she can read futures; others insist she merely sees more *paths* than ordinary people, and remembers too well where they might end.

Tia’s official role is to oversee disciplines of **Mind and Sight** — perception, mental defense, and the careful study of what lies beyond ordinary senses. Unofficially, her advice is sought by Masters, civic leaders, and the occasional desperate student who wants to know if a choice they are considering is worth the cost.

## Appearance

- Slender, with an ageless quality that makes it difficult to guess exactly how long she has been at Azuria.  
- Pale hair worn in loose braids, often threaded with thin cords bearing tiny crystal or metal charms.  
- Robes in muted blues and deep grays, with subtle eye and star motifs near the hems.  
- Her eyes have a distant-focus habit, as if constantly adjusting to more than one layer of reality.

## Personality

- **Quiet but direct** – Tia wastes few words. When she speaks, people listen.  
- **Compassionate, from a distance** – She seems to care deeply, but maintains a careful emotional boundary, perhaps out of necessity.  
- **Unnervingly perceptive** – Tends to answer questions you did not quite ask.  
- Sometimes makes small, practical jokes that remind students she is not purely an omen wrapped in robes.

## Notable Scenes

- **Terrace Conversation with Reyna** – On the eve of major exams, Tia encounters Reyna lingering on an otherwise empty sky terrace. The discussion that follows does not provide clear promises, but Reyna walks away with a sharpened sense of what she truly fears — and what she might want.  
- **Council Consultation** – During a closed meeting, Tia is asked to comment on possible outcomes involving **Dislow Garrison** and increased activity in the Lucelus Desert. Her response, recorded only in part, is said to have changed the tone of the discussion entirely.  
- **Unexpected Visit to an Infirmary Bed** – A student, recovering from an incident in a practice chamber, wakes to find Tia sitting nearby, watching the patterns of their breathing. She offers no prophecy, only a story about a choice she once made — without saying explicitly whether she regrets it.

> *“I do not see ‘the future’,” Tia once told an impatient apprentice.  
> “I see possibilities, many of them unpleasant. My work is to help people walk among them without losing themselves.”*
