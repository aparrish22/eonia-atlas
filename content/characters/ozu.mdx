# Ozu

Ozu arrived at Azuria a year ahead of Reyna and never quite stopped moving. When he is not in a laboratory or study hall, he is crossing courtyards two steps at a time, sketching ideas in the margins of handouts, or talking his way into restricted lectures “just to listen.” Festival nights find him weaving through crowds in Roanthur, collecting stories and rumors as enthusiastically as he collects data.

Now an **Advanced Apprentice**, Ozu stands at the threshold of being chosen — or choosing himself — for work beyond the Academy walls. Some Masters see him as a natural researcher; others quietly wonder how he will react when the problems he studies begin to stare back.

## Appearance

- Lean frame, restless posture, and expressive hands that move almost as much as his thoughts.  
- Keeps his hair shorter than Academy fashion, allegedly because “burnt ends are a poor look on anyone.”  
- Robes and coats often sport extra pockets filled with notebooks, bits of chalk, and improvised tools.  
- Nearly always carries a satchel worn from both books and field kits.

## Personality

- **Curious to a fault** – Ozu hates the phrase “we don’t know” and hears in it an invitation.  
- **Loyal** – Once he decides someone is his friend, he will quietly rearrange his priorities to back them up, even at personal cost.  
- **Optimistic in public, more cautious in private** – He projects confidence, but keeps his own ledger of potential failures.  
- Enjoys challenging assumptions, including Masters’ assumptions, though he usually knows when to stop — usually.

## Notable Scenes

- **Lab Incident with Controlled Variables** – During an experiment that begins to drift dangerously, Ozu notices a pattern misalignment others miss. His quick adjustment prevents a cascade failure, earning him both a reprimand for improvisation and a commendation for awareness.  
- **Harbor Conversation During Festival** – On the night of the Cloudless Eve Festival, Ozu walks the lower docks with Reyna rather than joining louder festivities. Their talk ranges from exam fears to rumors about Dislow Garrison and postings that might await them.  
- **Offer from a Master** – A quiet conversation in a back-corridor office presents Ozu with a choice: remain safely within Azuria as a researcher, or accept an assignment that would place him uncomfortably close to the eastern frontier.

> “The trick is deciding whether you learn from it… or run.”*
