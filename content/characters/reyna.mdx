# Reyna

The night air in Roanthur always feels a little thinner before exams. Reyna noticed it the first time she climbed the Academy terraces during the **Cloudless Eve Festival**, lantern light trembling on stone as if the city itself were as nervous as its students. That night, she walked with a book under one arm and festival sweets in the other, caught somewhere between duty and the desire to pretend, just for a moment, that magic and grades and expectations could wait.

Reyna is a **Novice Apprentice** at Azuria Academy, poised at the edge between structured theory and the kind of field work that changes people. Professors speak well of her discipline and precision; friends quietly worry about how rarely she allows herself to be uncertain. She has learned to carry the weight of being “promising” with a practiced half-smile.

Those who watch closely, however, notice small cracks: the way her hand sometimes lingers over opportunities she does not take, the flicker of curiosity when talk turns to the frontier, or to things the Academy prefers to classify as *unwise*.

## Appearance

- Dark hair usually tied back in a practical knot, occasionally escaping in loose strands during long study nights.  
- Steady, dark eyes that scan rooms quickly, cataloguing exits, people, and potential problems.  
- Prefers fitted Academy robes or layered tunics with subtle embroidered sigils at the cuffs.  
- Often seen with ink stains on fingers and the faint scent of tea from countless late hours over notes.

## Personality

- **Disciplined and deliberate** – Reyna thinks before she acts, and often thinks again afterward to see what she missed.  
- **Warm but guarded** – She cares deeply about a small circle of people, but shares her fears and doubts with very few.  
- **Drawn to structure, tempted by risk** – Officially, she adheres to Academy procedure. Unofficially, she is fascinated by stories of field mages and those posted to places like Dislow Garrison.  
- Has a dry sense of humor that surfaces most clearly when she is exhausted or with people she trusts, like **Ozu**.

## Notable Scenes

- **Night in Roanthur Before Finals** – During the Cloudless Eve Festival, Reyna walks the city streets trying to calm her mind. Instead of joining the loudest crowds, she finds a quieter vantage point overlooking the festivities with a friend, sharing half-honest worries about the future as distant music rises from below.  
- **First Advanced Demonstration** – In a supervised session, Reyna stabilizes a complex pattern that begins to fray under unexpected interference. She recovers by trusting her own intuition rather than the textbook sequence — something a certain Master quietly notes.  
- **Unscheduled Meeting on the Terrace** – After a difficult critique, she encounters **Visionary Tia** on a half-empty sky terrace. The conversation that follows leaves Reyna with more questions than answers about what her abilities might become *outside* the Academy’s current plans for her.

> *“I don’t need to be the best,” Reyna once muttered into her notes.  
> “I just need to be someone who doesn’t break when it matters.”*
