# Master Brinian

Master Brinian’s classrooms are warm. Not uncomfortably so, but enough that Initiates notice the way candles steady themselves and braziers never quite go out in his presence. Where Dunnobow deals in lines and structures, **Brinian deals in currents**: heat, force, motion, and the unseen flows of power through the body and world.

Brinian is known for his **patience and unblinking focus**. He can listen to a student’s stumbling explanation longer than most Masters, then answer with a single, well-aimed question that forces them to reconsider everything they thought they understood.

## Appearance

- Broad-shouldered, with sun-browned skin and calloused hands that suggest a history of physical labor before the Academy.  
- Wears layered robes in earth and ember tones, often with rolled-up sleeves in the practice halls.  
- Dark hair is tied back loosely; a streak of gray runs through one temple.  
- Eyes that seem to weigh not just what someone says, but how they breathe while they say it.

## Personality

- **Calm and grounded** – Brinian rarely shows anger; when he grows quiet, students realize they have truly misjudged something.  
- **Protective** – He prioritizes safety, both physical and emotional, in essence-channeling disciplines.  
- **Pragmatic** – Will cheerfully discard elegant theories if they do not hold up in field conditions.  
- Known for offering second chances — once. A third chance is rarely on the table.

## Notable Scenes

- **First Controlled Channeling Exercise** – Brinian walks students through drawing heat into a stone and then letting it bleed away. The lesson is not about power, but about recognizing their own limits before the stone cracks.  
- **Witness to a Student’s Breaking Point** – After a particularly brutal exam cycle, Brinian finds a student alone in an empty practice hall, fists clenched, essence flickering uncontrolled. He does not scold. He sits, waits, and then begins a lesson framed as “breathing practice,” though it is clearly more than that.  
- **Consultation on an Expedition** – When rumors reach Azuria of strange phenomena near the Dislow Heights, Brinian is among those asked to advise. His response is quiet: “Send people who know how to stop before the line, and one who will step over it if they must.”

> *“You are not a vessel for power,” Brinian tells his classes.  
> “You are a person who may, sometimes, carry it. Remember which part matters.”*
