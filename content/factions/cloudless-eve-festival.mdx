# The Cloudless Eve Festival

The **Cloudless Eve Festival** takes place on the night before Azuria Academy’s major exam cycles. Officially, it is a civic celebration marking Roanthur’s role as the “Cloudless City” and Kircia’s enduring prosperity. Unofficially, it is the night when students try to forget, or at least soften, the weight of what awaits them at dawn.

Lanterns bloom along the harbor, up through the Market Quarter, and all the way to the lower slopes of the Academy Rise. Music drifts from taverns and street performers, the air thick with smells of grilled fish, sweetbreads, and citrus-sugar glazes that cling to fingers and parchment alike.

## Traditions

- **Lantern Lines** – Families and students hang strings of small lanterns outside homes and dormitories, each flame representing hopes for the season ahead.  
- **Harbor Processions** – Boats decked with lights drift slowly along the harbor, accompanied by music and cheers from the docks.  
- **Exam Charms** – Market stalls sell small, mostly harmless charms allegedly blessed by Masters or favored guilds. Most are little more than trinkets, but a few carry genuinely subtle effects.

For many Initiates and Apprentices, the Festival is a night of choices: bury themselves in last-minute study, step nervously into celebration, or try to balance both and risk doing neither well.

## Perspective from Azuria

From the terraces of **Azuria Academy**, the Cloudless Eve Festival looks like a field of stars spilled across the city below. Some Masters watch with fondness, remembering their own festival nights. Others close shutters, preferring not to be reminded how much of their work rests on the fragile balance between stress and hope.

Students like **Reyna** and **Ozu** often experience their most honest conversations during Cloudless Eve: truths shared under lantern light feel somehow safer, as if the city itself is listening and promising to keep their secrets — at least until morning.

> The Cloudless Eve belongs to the night, and to everyone who needs one more breath before stepping into whatever comes next.*
