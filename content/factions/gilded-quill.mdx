# The Gilded Quill

The **Gilded Quill** presents itself as a guild of scribes, editors, and record-keepers. To the public, they copy contracts, transcribe proceedings, and produce beautifully bound volumes for collectors and institutions. Within Azuria Academy and Roanthur’s inner circles, however, the Quill is understood to be much more than pretty handwriting.

Members of the Gilded Quill specialize in **information**: collecting it, preserving it, and deciding who may see which piece, and when. Some are embedded in the Academy as archivists or lecture recorders; others work within civic offices, courtrooms, or merchant houses.

## Structure and Influence

- **Inkmasters** – Senior members who oversee specific archives or information networks.  
- **Linekeepers** – Intermediaries responsible for ensuring records remain accurate — or officially “accurate enough.”  
- **Plumists** – Junior members and apprentices who perform copying, indexing, and legwork.

The Quill maintains close ties with Azuria Academy, providing meticulous record-keeping for research and Council sessions. In return, they receive early access to certain findings and the chance to steer how those findings are described when they leave the Academy.

## Reputation

- Among students, joining the Gilded Quill is seen as a path to **influence without overt power**.  
- Among merchants and minor officials, the Quill is both useful and faintly unsettling; no one likes the idea that their words might outlive them in carefully curated archives.  
- Some Masters tolerate them; others rely on them heavily.

> *“Ink outlives a great many brave speeches,” an InkMaster once said.  
> “We simply decide which speeches deserve the privilege.”*
