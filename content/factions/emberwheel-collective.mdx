# The Emberwheel Collective

The **Emberwheel Collective** is a loose association of artificers, crafters, and experimenters whose workshops cluster in the districts between Roanthur’s Market Quarter and the Academy Rise. Their work ranges from practical enchantments for ships and mills to devices that even Azuria’s Masters approach with caution.

Rather than formal ranks, the Collective recognizes **reputation and results**. Those who build devices that do not explode — or that explode in interesting, informative ways — rise quickly in esteem.

## Work and Philosophy

- Blending **pattern magic** with gears, lenses, and mundane engineering.  
- Creating tools that allow non-mages to safely leverage limited magical effects.  
- Testing prototypes in controlled environments… or, occasionally, in the field when “controlled” proves too limiting.

Some Advanced Apprentices from Azuria split their time between the Academy and Emberwheel workshops, walking a careful line between institutional expectations and the Collective’s more improvisational culture.

## Relationship with Azuria and Kircia

- Azuria views the Collective as both **opportunity and risk**: a source of innovation that must be watched.  
- The Kircia Crown appreciates devices that improve infrastructure or defense, but grows wary when rumors circulate of less stable experiments.  
- Merchant houses with an eye for advantage quietly fund certain Emberwheel projects.

> “we probably didn’t aim high enough.”*
