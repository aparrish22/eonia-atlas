# The Ardent Wardens

The **Ardent Wardens** are less a traditional guild and more an **order of specialists**, trained to design, maintain, and reinforce defensive wards across Kircia. Their sigil — a silver line encircling a stylized horizon — appears discretely on boundary stones, fortress gates, and sometimes on unseen anchors deep beneath important structures.

Many of the most capable Wardens trace their training back to Azuria Academy, often under Masters like **Dunnobow**. Others come from military backgrounds, bringing practical experience in fortification and logistics.

## Duties and Reach

- Inspecting and renewing **city ward-lines** and harbor protections.  
- Consulting on defenses for key locations such as **Dislow Garrison** and remote watchposts.  
- Developing mobile warding patterns that can be carried into the field by trusted units.

While their headquarters sit in Roanthur, the Ardent Wardens spend much of their time away from it, traveling the kingdom’s borders and pressure points.

## Reputation

- In Kircia’s interior, most citizens know of the Wardens only through stories.  
- On the frontier, their visits are greeted with a mixture of relief and uneasy expectation; things rarely remain quiet for long when the Ardent Wardens appear.  
- Within Azuria, ambitious students sometimes whisper about being “noticed” by the Wardens and tapped for future work.

> *“If we do our work well,” one Warden remarked,  
> “nothing spectacular happens. That is the entire point.”*
